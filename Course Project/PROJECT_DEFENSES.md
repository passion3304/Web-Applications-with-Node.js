# Course Project defenses

##  General requirements

- All members of the team **must be present** at the project defense
  - Any missing member will be considered as **not-participating**

##  Prerequisites

-  Team members must be on site at the appointed time slot with:
  - **Ready-to-run** project
    - `$ npm start` must start the application
    - The version of the application **must be as it was on August 01, 10:00 AM**
      - All later changes to the code-base will be skipped
  - **Working version in the cloud**
    - The applications must be presented in a cloud environment
    - The local copy of the application is just for convenience and code explanation
  - **Be strict in time**
    - The schedule is tight and any delay is unwelcome
  - If any of the above is not met, the team will lose their slot for defense and must wait for another opening
  - Each team member must be **competent with at least 80% of the application**

##  Defense Procedure

Each team has exactly 30 minutes for their defense. They will be split as follows:

1.  Each team member presents part of the application that they had worked on
  - Each team member has **10 minutes** to present "their" part of the project
2.  The trainer asks questions

- Keep in mind, that if the trainer has **suspicions about the participation of a team member**, he can give him/her a specific a specific task to be done immediately
  - Add a one more property on a database document
  - Add a new route with authentication
  - Any other
