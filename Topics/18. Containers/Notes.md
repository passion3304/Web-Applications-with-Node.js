## Containers, Docker and AWS

- Hosting applications
    - Past - Physical
        - Overpowered
        - Overpriced
    - Present - Virtual
        - OS Overhead
        - Licence hell
    - Future - Containers

- Physical servers
    - How they work

- Virtual servers
    - Pros
        - High utalization of server resources
        - Application isolation
    - Cons
        - Resource and budget overhead
        - Licensing hell

- Containers
    - Pros
        - Fast
        - Lightweight
    - Cons
    - Usage
        - CI/CD Workflows
        - Infrastructure

    - Ecosystem
    - Usage
        - Cloud
            - Docker Hub
            - Docker Tantrum
    - Workspace as containers
    - Installation
        - Windows
            - Requirements
                - Windows 10 Pro or Ultimate
                - CPU Virtualization support
                    - Enable Virtualization in BIOS settings
                    - Enable Hyper-V in Windows Features settings
            - Docker for Windows
                - Runs a Moby Linux VM on Hyper-V
                - Docker settings
        - Windows Server
            - Requirements
                - At least Windows Server 2016 Standard or
                - At least Windows 10 (Pro or Ultimate) Anniversary (10.0.14396)
                - Enable Containers in Windows Features settings
            - PS Install-PackageProvider ContainerImage -Force
            - PS Find-ContainerImage
            - PS Install-ContainerImage WindowsServerCore
                - The core is 9GB in size
                - We do this because of licensing issues
                - Cannot host windows container images on standard public registries
        - Mac
            - Hardware from at least after 2010
            - Software at least 10.10.3v
        - Linux
            - Most distros 
                - wged -qO- https://get.docker.com/ | sh
            - Have a weird/rare distro?
                - DuckDuckGo it..

-  Working with containers
    - docker version
        - info about client and server
        - they can run on seperate machines
    - docker info
        - shit lots of info about docker client
    - docker run hello-world
        - how it works
            - we call the Client with that command
            - the client sends API calls to the Daemon
            - the Daemon performs the following operations
                - finds and image locally
                - if cannot be found locally, it downloads it from Docker Hub
                - uses the image as a template to build a new container
                    - prints texts to the screen and exists
    - commands
        - run - Creates a new container based on a given image and starts it
            - params
                - d - Detach container's shell
                - it - Attack to container's STDIN
                - p - assign port in the format machine:container
        - start
        - stop
        - images - shows a list of images on the local docker host
        - rmi - removes an image
        - ps - shows running containers
            - params
                - a - shows running and exited containers
        - rm - removes a given container (data volumes persist)
    - lifecycle
        - Containers start with a single process PID 1.
        - Once the process exits, the container exits with the process's exit code. 
    - swarms
        - loadbalancer - native container-aware loadbalancer called "routing mesh"
